## How It Works

### During Recording:

```
User clicks "Start Recording"
         ↓
AssemblyAI WebSocket opens (~100ms)
         ↓
User speaks: "Tell me about a time..."
         ↓
Audio chunks sent every 250ms
         ↓
Interim transcripts: "Tell me..." → "Tell me about..." → "Tell me about a time..."
         ↓
User clicks "Stop Recording"
         ↓
Final transcript ready immediately!
         ↓
AI analysis begins (1-2s)
```

### Fallback Behavior:

```
If AssemblyAI fails:
  ├─ Show toast: "Streaming failed, using standard transcription"
  ├─ Set useStreamingTranscription = false
  └─ Use legacy Whisper batch transcription
```

## Visual Changes

### Before:
```
[Recording...]
(user waits 30 seconds)
(no feedback)

[Stop] → (loading...) → Transcript appears (2-5s later)
```

### After:
```
[Recording ⚡]
↓
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tell me about a time...          │ ← Words appear as spoken!
│ you overcame a challenge         │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
↓
[Stop] → Transcript already complete → AI analysis (1-2s)
```
