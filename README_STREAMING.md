## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "AssemblyAI API key not found"
→ Check `.env.local` exists and contains `VITE_ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_key`
→ Restart dev server

### No real-time transcription appearing
→ Check browser console for errors
→ Verify microphone permissions granted
→ Check network tab for WebSocket connection to `wss://api.assemblyai.com`

### Streaming fails and falls back to Whisper
→ This is expected behavior!
→ Check AssemblyAI dashboard for credit balance
→ Verify API key is valid

### High latency (>2 seconds)
→ Check internet connection
→ Close bandwidth-heavy apps
→ Try different network
